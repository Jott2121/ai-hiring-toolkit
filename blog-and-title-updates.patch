+          AI recruiting tools are everywhere now. Every vendor claims they&apos;ll save you 20 hours per hire, find hidden gems, predict job fit with 95% accuracy, or replace your whole recruiting process overnight.
+        </p>
+
+        <p>
+          Most of that is hype.
+        </p>
+
+        <p>
+          Some of it actually works. This is an honest breakdown of what AI is genuinely good at in hiring, what it&apos;s terrible at, and which tools are worth your money for small teams.
+        </p>
+
+        {/* ── What AI is Actually Good At ── */}
+        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">
+          What AI Is Actually Good At in Recruiting
+        </h2>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">1. Resume Screening (Saves 5&ndash;10 hours per hire)</h3>
+        <p>
+          This is where AI shines. You get 100 resumes for an engineering role. AI can quickly scan them, extract key signals (years of experience, tech stack, education), and create a ranked list. It won&apos;t replace human judgment, but it&apos;ll cut the time you spend reading through bad fits by 80%.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Best for:</strong> High-volume roles where you get 50+ applications.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Reality check:</strong> AI will miss nuance. A candidate who&apos;s missing a required skill but has built something adjacent might be great. AI doesn&apos;t see that. You still need to eyeball the top 20&ndash;30 candidates.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">2. Writing Job Descriptions (Saves 1&ndash;2 hours)</h3>
+        <p>
+          Give AI a rough outline of your role and it can generate a polished, candidate-friendly JD in minutes. It&apos;ll structure it properly, fix jargon, and make it compelling.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams without an HR person and limited writing bandwidth.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Reality check:</strong> AI-generated JDs are often generic. You need to customize them with specific details about your company, mission, and what makes this role unique. Don&apos;t just copy-paste.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">3. Generating Interview Questions (Saves 30 min&ndash;1 hour)</h3>
+        <p>
+          AI can generate behavioral, technical, and culture-fit interview questions customized to your role. You get 20+ questions instantly instead of brainstorming them yourself.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that don&apos;t interview often and need a starting point.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Reality check:</strong> Generic questions yield generic answers. The questions that matter most are ones about your specific role, company, and challenges. AI can&apos;t write those without deep context.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">4. Boolean Search Generation (Saves 30 min&ndash;1 hour)</h3>
+        <p>
+          Need to source senior backend engineers who know Kubernetes? AI can generate Boolean search strings for LinkedIn, GitHub, and other platforms in seconds. They work surprisingly well.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams actively sourcing on LinkedIn or GitHub.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Reality check:</strong> AI-generated searches are broad starting points. You&apos;ll need to refine them based on results. But it beats staring at a blank search box.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">5. Personalized Outreach (Saves 2&ndash;3 hours)</h3>
+        <p>
+          Outreach at scale is tedious. AI can generate personalized outreach templates for 20+ candidates in minutes&mdash;&quot;I saw you built X on GitHub, we&apos;re working on similar problems at Y&quot;&mdash;and you just need to review and send.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Best for:</strong> Proactive sourcing campaigns.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Reality check:</strong> Candidates can smell templated outreach from a mile away. Use AI as a starting point, but add personal touches if you want responses.
+        </p>
+
+        {/* ── What AI is Bad At ── */}
+        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">
+          What AI Is Bad At in Recruiting (Don&apos;t Trust It)
+        </h2>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">1. Evaluating Culture Fit</h3>
+        <p>
+          AI vendors claim they can predict whether someone will fit your team. This is largely marketing. Culture fit is subjective, context-dependent, and requires human judgment. AI can&apos;t evaluate whether someone will gel with your team, challenge the status quo, or thrive in your specific environment.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">2. Making Final Hiring Decisions</h3>
+        <p>
+          Some vendors pitch AI as a &quot;final decision-maker.&quot; Don&apos;t use it that way. Hiring is a human decision. AI should inform it, not make it. The person being hired matters too much to delegate to an algorithm.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">3. Evaluating Communication and Soft Skills</h3>
+        <p>
+          AI can scan a resume, but it can&apos;t listen to a candidate explain their thought process, assess how clearly they think through problems, or notice whether they ask good questions. These require real conversations.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">4. Predicting Job Performance</h3>
+        <p>
+          Every AI vendor claims their algorithm can predict who&apos;ll succeed. The research is mixed at best. Past behavior is a better predictor than any scoring algorithm. Talk to references. Do real interviews.
+        </p>

+        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">
+          The AI Recruiting Tool Landscape
+        </h2>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Enterprise Tools ($500+/month)</h3>
+        <p>
+          These are for companies hiring dozens of people per year. They integrate with your ATS, do advanced screening, and offer phone/video interview analysis.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Examples:</strong> Workable, Lever, Greenhouse (with AI add-ons), iCIMS.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>For small teams:</strong> Overkill unless you&apos;re hiring constantly. The setup and learning curve aren&apos;t worth it.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Lightweight Tools ($50&ndash;$200/month)</h3>
+        <p>
+          Focused on specific pain points. Good for small teams because they&apos;re simple and inexpensive.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Resume screening:</strong> Lever AI, Manatal, hireEZ.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>JD writing:</strong> Gem, MeritForge, ChatGPT + custom prompt.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Sourcing:</strong> Gem, Apollo, Hunter.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          <strong>Interview question generation:</strong> ChatGPT or Claude with a good prompt.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">DIY Approach (Free&ndash;$50/month)</h3>
+        <p>
+          If you&apos;re comfortable with AI, you can build most of this yourself:
+        </p>
+        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
+          <li>
+            <strong>Resume screening:</strong> Upload resumes to ChatGPT or Claude, ask it to score them against your must-haves.
+          </li>
+          <li>
+            <strong>JD writing:</strong> &quot;Write a 600-word job description for a senior backend engineer at a Series A startup focused on...&quot;
+          </li>
+          <li>
+            <strong>Interview questions:</strong> &quot;Generate 15 behavioral questions for a product manager role...&quot;
+          </li>
+          <li>
+            <strong>Boolean strings:</strong> &quot;Generate 3 LinkedIn Boolean search strings to find senior data scientists with Python and MLOps experience...&quot;
+          </li>
+        </ul>
+
+        {/* ── Real ROI ── */}
+        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">
+          The Real ROI: What You&apos;ll Actually Save
+        </h2>
+
+        <p>
+          Hiring is expensive. Here&apos;s what a good AI tool stack realistically saves:
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Time Savings: 15+ Hours Per Hire</h3>
+        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
+          <li>Resume screening: 5&ndash;8 hours saved (AI does first pass, you review top candidates)</li>
+          <li>JD writing: 1&ndash;2 hours saved</li>
+          <li>Interview prep: 1&ndash;2 hours saved</li>
+          <li>Sourcing: 3&ndash;5 hours saved (proactive outreach takes less time)</li>
+        </ul>
+
+        <p>
+          That&apos;s meaningful for a small team. If you&apos;re hiring 4&ndash;5 people per year, that&apos;s 60&ndash;80 hours annually.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Consistency in Evaluation</h3>
+        <p>
+          AI forces you to define what you&apos;re looking for before you start screening. This reduces bias (no more gut-feel hiring) and ensures you evaluate candidates consistently. That&apos;s underrated.
+        </p>
+
+        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Better Candidate Experience</h3>
+        <p>
+          Faster screening means faster feedback. Automated status updates mean candidates aren&apos;t left wondering if you&apos;re interested. This matters for your employer brand, especially when you pass on someone.
+        </p>
+
+        {/* ── The Bottom Line ── */}
+        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">
+          The Bottom Line: AI Is a Tool, Not a Replacement
+        </h2>
+
+        <p>
+          AI can handle the scut work of recruiting: scanning resumes, drafting JDs, generating questions, finding candidates. What it can&apos;t do is make judgment calls about whether someone will actually be great at your company.
+        </p>
+
+        <p>
+          The best recruiting process is: AI does the filtering, humans do the evaluation. AI speeds things up, humans ensure quality.
+        </p>
+
+        <p>
+          For small teams, I&apos;d recommend:
+        </p>
+
+        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
+          <li>
+            <strong>For resume screening:</strong> Use a lightweight tool ($100&ndash;$200/month) or ChatGPT. This saves the most time.
+          </li>
+          <li>
+            <strong>For JD writing, questions, and Boolean strings:</strong> Start with ChatGPT (free) and customize from there.
+          </li>
+          <li>
+            <strong>For phone and video interviews:</strong> Do them yourself. This is where you assess communication and fit.
+          </li>
+          <li>
+            <strong>For final decisions:</strong> Keep humans in the room. Your team should make the call, not the algorithm.
+          </li>
+        </ol>
+
+        <p>
+          Don&apos;t fall for vendors claiming their tool will &quot;hire perfect candidates&quot; or &quot;predict job fit.&quot; Recruiting is still fundamentally about human judgment. AI just makes it faster and more consistent.
+        </p>

+          <li>

+            <strong>They bury the good stuff.</strong> The interesting parts of your role &mdash; the mission, the team, the impact &mdash; get lost in a sea of corporate jargon and checkbox requirements.
+          </li>
+          <li>

+
+        <p>
+          Great job descriptions flip the script. Instead of starting with &quot;We need someone who...&quot; they start with &quot;Here&apos;s what you&apos;ll build / learn / own.&quot;
+        </p>
+
+        <p>
+          This isn&apos;t marketing spin. It&apos;s clarity. A strong candidate doesn&apos;t want to hear your laundry list of requirements. They want to know: What will I actually do? What will I learn? Who will I work with? How much will I grow?

+        </h2>
+
+        <p>
+          <strong>1. Write for your actual candidate, not HR.</strong> If you&apos;re hiring a backend engineer, imagine one of your best current engineers reading it. Would they find it compelling? Would they think it&apos;s a good fit? If not, rewrite.
+        </p>
+
+        <p>
+          <strong>2. Keep it under 700 words.</strong> Long JDs get skimmed. If you need more than that to explain the role, you probably need to cut something.
+        </p>
+
+        <p>
+          <strong>3. Be honest about what the role actually is.</strong> If there&apos;s on-call, say so. If there&apos;s heavy mentoring, say so. If the team is dysfunctional, fix that instead of hiding it in a JD. Transparency attracts better candidates.
